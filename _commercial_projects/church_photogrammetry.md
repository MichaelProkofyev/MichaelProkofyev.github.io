Photogrammetry project of SpheraVR studio, that I've been involved with.

We've spent the whole night locked in a local, Saint-Petersburg monastery with several photographers, shooting every inch of the huge, two-storied space.
After that, we've embarked on a months-long journey of generating hi-poly meshes, cleaning them & assembling into a coherent virtual location, as a GearVR app.
Sadly, even though the app was completed, it was never released on GooglePlay(or anywhere else).

Participated as a sole Unity3D developer and managed multiple remote 3D artists.
